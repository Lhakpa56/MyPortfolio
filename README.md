ðŸ§¾ Extended Description (Optional)

This portfolio website was built with the goal of showcasing my journey, skills, and the work Iâ€™ve done so far in web development and design. It serves as a digital resume, a hub for my projects, and a way for potential clients or employers to get in touch with me.

I focused on creating a clean, minimal, and fully responsive layout using only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate my understanding of the core web technologies without relying on external frameworks. Every section and animation is hand-coded, which helped me improve my knowledge of layout techniques, responsive design principles, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

This project also represents my commitment to learning and growing as a developer. I regularly update this portfolio with new projects, design improvements, and additional features like a contact form or downloadable resume.

In future updates, I plan to:

Add a blog section to share my learning and insights

Integrate a backend (Node.js or PHP) for form handling

Include project filtering and search functionality
